## Time commitment and management

In the syllabus, we say that:

    In Students should expect to dedicate at least six hours a week to this
    course, ...

The study time can be broken down, roughly, into the following segments.

*   One hour. Prepare (before the lab) and complete the lab assignment, ideally
    on the lab day. 

*   One to two hours. Review slides. Read textbook, if necessary.

*   Three to four hours. Complete the homework assignments.  

*   One hour. Attend office hours. Discuss on Discord.

*   Do additional reading (textbook, reference books, etc.), if you have time. 

This is for students who have good learning and problem solving skills and
attend lectures/lab sessions. Very often, students missing lectures and lab
sessions need more time to catch up.
