# Getting prepared

*Deadline:* Friday, 8/30/2024.

We will keep the submission open until Wed, 9/11/2024, for students who
need additional time on the first assignment.

*If you work on a lab computer or UConn AnyWare Desktop, save your files to
cloud storage like OneDrive. Otherwise, you may lose your files.*

Read the Deliverables carefully at the end of the page.

Lab 0 is graded automatically. We do not adjust grades manually. Students
should submit their work early to get feedback and improve their grades if
necessary.

## Learning Objectives

*   Run a RISC-V programs in RARS. 

*   Submit code in Gradescope.

*   Convert non-negative numbers in one radix to another.

*   Take a quiz in HuskyCT.

## Description

### Task 1

Follow the instructions on [this
page](https://github.com/zhijieshi/cse3666/blob/master/misc/rars.md) to install
RARS and run RISC-V programs in RARS. 

Download `lab0.s`. The RARS instructions page mentioned in the previous
paragraph has a section about "Download files from GitHub". The page also has a
link to more [RISC-V
examples.](https://github.com/zhijieshi/cse3666/tree/master/rv-examples).

Modify the `msg` string in lab0.s so the program prints the following. There is
a newline, but no space, after the ending dot.

    Hello, welcome to CSE 3666. Here also comes the second spring.

Submit revised `lab0.s` in Gradescope. There is a link in HuskyCT. The
submitted filename must be `lab0.s`. It is case sensitive. The system does NOT
accept names like `Lab0.s`.

### Task 2

Study the slides in `lab0-numbers.pdf` to learn/review conversion of numbers in
different radices. 

*   Binary to decimal.
*   Decimal to binary.
*   Hexadecimal to decimal.
*   Decimal to hexadecimal.

Practice on [this page](https://zhijieshi.github.io/cse3666/binarynumbers/).
For now, you can click the Config button and uncheck "Bits are signed".

## Deliverables

Submit `lab0.s` in Gradescope and complete lab0-test in HuskyCT. 

The submission pages will be created before the lab sessions.
