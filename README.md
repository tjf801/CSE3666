### Course Information

**Credits:** 3

**Prerequisites:** CSE2050, CSE3100

### Course Description

### Textbook

David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy. Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware Software Interface (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design) 2nd Edition, Morgan Kaufmann. Dec 2020. ISBN-13: 978-0128203316

### Course Goals and Objectives

1. Represent data (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, instructions.) with bits.
2. Program with RISC-V instructions (computing with instructions).
3. Design an instruction set architecture (ISA). For example, describe types of instructions, encode/decode instructions, and identify and apply good design principles.
4. Design a digital circuit (e.g., arithmetic-logic unit) with logic gates.
5. Design a processor that supports a specified ISA.
6. Design a processor pipeline and handle data and control hazards.
7. Design memory cache in a computer system.
8. Evaluate the performance of a computer system.
